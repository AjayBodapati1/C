While I do not have exams on all these days, there are 2-3 gap days between my exam days (e.g., I have an exam on 1st May, and the next one on 5th May). During the HR Connect session last Friday, it was suggested that interns take WFH on gap days and apply for leave on exam days. Some interns from my college have already received WFH access from their managers.

Additionally, Gopinath (HR) mentioned that as per the hybrid working policy, we are eligible for remote working for two weeks from a non-based location while being stationed at our base location otherwise.

I kindly request your approval for WFH on my exam gap days so that I can manage both my academics and internship responsibilities effectively. Please let me know if any further details are required.

Looking forward to your response.
